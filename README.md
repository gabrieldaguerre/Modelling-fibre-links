In this matlab code, we plot the noisy signals in function of time for a given bitrate for 3 distances L1, L2, L3. The pulse width is 2 times smaller than the time spacing between pulses.
When we change the bitrate b, we need to change the pulse width too.
There are a 5 bit configuration but I didn't the noise, there are still the 5 bits pulses with only dispersion. An improvment would be to add attenuation and noise to these pulses..
